<h2> Getting started 🧑‍💻</h2>
<p>Make sure you have go installed: <a href="https://go.dev/doc/install">Install Go</a></p>
<p>This project would use v1.24.5</p>

<p>Clone the repository:</p>

```
$ git clone https://github.com/ElevatEd-Devs/ElevatEd_backend
```

<p>Make sure to set up the .env file: for more info send a message to the backend channel on discord</p>

<p>For live reloading make sure your have <a href="https://github.com/air-verse/air">air</a> installed</p>

```
$ go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
```
<p>Now that your have air installed run the following in the project directory:</p>

```
$ air
```
<p>This would start the server and listen for changes in the program</p>  

<p>You could  also just run the server normally with:</p>

```
$ go run main.go
```

<h4>For Ubuntu users</h4>
<p> You may face some challenges with running air on different terminals, here is a work around: </p>

```
$ export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/go/bin
$ source ~/.bashrc
$ air
```
